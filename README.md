## My solutions to training.olinfo.it problems

OII training.olinfo.it is the official training website of the Italian Olympiads in Informatics!

This repository contains my solutions to a subset of the problems contained in the website.  If you are also trying to solve the problems, I recommend not looking into my solution at first but rather try on your own first and later compare your strategy with mine. 

Reminder: a problem may be solved in many different way.
